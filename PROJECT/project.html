                    Alongside their academic exploration, the students at SPPS participate in diverse clubs and student organizations. Steeped in the principles of independency and responsibility, student organizations are completely student-led, thus creating a community that thinks spontaneously, moves ambitiously and plays responsibly. More than 22 clubs plan numerous school-wide events each school year and work closely with the faculty and staffs to host meaningful activities. In learning how to balance academic pursuits and extracurricular interests, students develop various organization skills that are critical to their social development. The school's intimate size facilitates student ownership and therefore deepends their commitments.
