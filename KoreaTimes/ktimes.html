            <p>South Korea's central bank raised its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point Thursday to rein in rising inflation pressure as the ongoing war in Ukraine has sent oil and major commodity prices even higher. The monetary policy board of the Bank of Korea (BOK) convened a rate-setting meeting earlier in the day and voted to raise the benchmark seven-day repo rate to 1.5 percent, according to the central bank. The hike came after the BOK has raised the rate in a preemptive and swift manner in recent months to keep a lid on inflation. Since August last year, the BOK has delivered three rate hikes, including the latest quarter parentage-point increase in January, after maintaining borrowing costs at record lows for about two years to tide over the pandemic.</p>
